# Quizportal
This repository has only frontend implementation of quiz portal.
Firstly, user is redirected to auth module, which has two components login and signup.
Based on credentials provided by user again he/she is redirected to either user or admin dashboard.
user dashboard has functionality to view quizzes, play quizzes.
admin can:
add quizzes.
add questions.
add categories.
Overall, this is a project that covers all advanced topics of Angular including Routing, Lazy Loading, Reactive Forms, HttpClient -module etc.

Developed a Dynamic Web Application with Angular

I successfully developed a dynamic web application leveraging the Angular frontend framework, demonstrating proficiency in key Angular concepts and ensuring an optimal user experience. Below are some of the core Angular features and best practices I applied:

Key Angular Concepts Applied:

1) HTTP-Client Module for API Calls:
Implemented the HttpClientModule to facilitate efficient and robust communication with external APIs.
Utilized various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations.
Implemented error handling mechanisms to manage HTTP errors gracefully, enhancing the application's reliability.

2) Reactive Forms for Dynamic Form Fields:
Employed Angular's ReactiveFormsModule to create complex and dynamic forms.
Used form control classes (FormGroup, FormControl, FormArray) to manage form inputs and validation.
Implemented custom validators to ensure data integrity and provide real-time feedback to users.

3) Lazy Loading for Improved Application Performance:
Applied lazy loading to modularize the application and load feature modules only when needed.
Improved initial load time and overall performance by reducing the size of the main bundle.
Enhanced user experience by ensuring that non-critical modules are loaded on demand.


4) Routing for Navigation Between Components:
Configured Angular Router to manage navigation between different components and views.
Implemented nested routes and route guards to manage access control and enhance security.
Used route parameters and query parameters to pass data and state information across different routes.


5) Additional Enhancements:
Responsive Design:
Ensured the application is mobile-friendly and provides a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
Used Angular Material and custom CSS for consistent and aesthetically pleasing UI components.

6)State Management:
Managed application state efficiently using services and state management libraries like NgRx.
Ensured data consistency and simplified complex state interactions across different components.


7)Testing and Debugging:
Wrote unit tests using Jasmine and Karma to ensure the reliability and robustness of the application.
Utilized Angular's debugging tools and practices to identify and resolve issues quickly.


Conclusion:
The dynamic web application built using Angular showcases a thorough understanding and application of key Angular concepts. By focusing on performance, scalability, and user experience, the project stands as a testament to my proficiency in Angular and my ability to deliver high-quality web solutions.
